My journey through Southern New Hampshire University's Computer Science program over the past three years has been transformative, evolving from someone seeking a career change to a confident developer ready to make meaningful contributions to public safety technology. What began as a desire to leave my previous job and earn a higher income has developed into a genuine passion for using technology to improve systems that save lives. My current role as a 911 dispatcher has given me unique insight into the challenges facing emergency services, and I'm excited to apply my technical skills to create more reliable, user-friendly applications that support first responders and dispatchers. 

Throughout my coursework and the development of this ePortfolio, I've discovered that I genuinely enjoy the problem-solving aspects of programming - those "aha" moments when a complex issue suddenly becomes clear. My capstone project, a Weight Tracking Android application that evolved from a basic local app to a sophisticated cloud-based system with user authentication and data analytics, perfectly demonstrates the range of skills I've developed and my ability to iterate and improve upon existing solutions. 

While my capstone project was individually developed, my coursework in CS250 (Software Development Lifecycle) taught me essential collaboration principles including version control with Git, code review processes, and agile methodologies. I've learned to write clear, well-documented code that other developers can easily understand and maintain - a crucial skill for any development team. My experience as a 911 dispatcher has also reinforced the importance of clear communication and teamwork under pressure, skills that translate directly to collaborative software development environments. 

Through courses like IT315 (Object Oriented Analysis and Design) and CS320 (Software Testing and Quality Assurance), I learned to translate user requirements into technical specifications and communicate complex technical concepts clearly. My enhancement narratives and code review video demonstrate my ability to explain technical decisions to both technical and non-technical audiences. Working as a dispatcher has taught me to communicate effectively with people in high-stress situations, a skill that's invaluable when gathering requirements from stakeholders or explaining technical constraints. 

CS260 (Data Structures and Algorithms) provided the foundation for implementing efficient solutions to real-world problems. In my capstone project, I demonstrated this knowledge by implementing a linear regression algorithm for weight trend analysis, using appropriate data structures like ArrayList and TreeMap for efficient data sorting and retrieval, and considering algorithmic complexity when processing time-series data. The algorithm handles edge cases gracefully and provides meaningful feedback to users. 

Courses like CS360 (Mobile Architecture and Programming) and DAD220 (Introduction to SQL) equipped me with both mobile development skills and database design principles. My capstone enhancement showcases advanced software engineering through the implementation of MVVM architecture, separation of concerns, and modular design. The database migration from local SQLite to AWS Amplify with DynamoDB demonstrates my understanding of both relational and NoSQL databases, cloud architecture, and scalable data design. 

CS405 (Secure Coding) and IT365 (Operating Environments) instilled a security-first mindset that permeates all my development work. My capstone project implements comprehensive security measures including input validation, authentication through AWS Cognito, secure token-based API communication, and user data isolation. I consistently anticipate potential vulnerabilities and implement defensive programming practices to protect user data and system integrity. 

My ePortfolio centers around a single, comprehensive artifact that demonstrates the full breadth of my computer science capabilities. The Weight Tracking Android application serves as an ideal showcase because it required integration of multiple complex systems and technologies while solving a real-world problem. The progression from a basic local app to a sophisticated cloud-based application illustrates my growth as a developer and my ability to enhance existing systems thoughtfully. 

The Software Design and Engineering enhancement demonstrates my mastery of modern Android development practices through the implementation of MVVM architecture, dependency injection for testability, and comprehensive unit testing with JUnit and Mockito. This transformation from a monolithic design to a modular, maintainable architecture shows my understanding of software engineering principles and my ability to refactor legacy code professionally. 

The Algorithms and Data Structures enhancement showcases my ability to apply mathematical concepts to create user value through the implementation of linear regression for weight trend analysis. This feature required careful consideration of data processing, edge case handling, and performance optimization while maintaining code readability and testability. 

The Database enhancement represents perhaps the most challenging aspect of the project, migrating from a local SQLite database to a cloud-based AWS solution with multi-user support and real-time synchronization. This enhancement demonstrates my ability to work with modern cloud technologies, implement secure authentication systems, and design scalable data architectures that support multiple users with complete data isolation. 

Together, these enhancements create a cohesive demonstration of my technical abilities spanning mobile development, cloud integration, algorithm implementation, secure coding practices, and modern software architecture. The project shows not just what I can build, but how I approach complex problems, iterate on solutions, and create maintainable, secure, and user-friendly applications. 

This ePortfolio and my Computer Science education have excellently prepared me for my goal of working in technical roles supporting 911 and public safety systems. The skills I've developed (particularly in mobile development, cloud architecture, real-time data processing, and security implementation) are directly applicable to the challenges facing modern emergency services. My experience building a multi-user application with real-time synchronization translates perfectly to developing CAD (Computer-aided Dispatch) systems that must handle multiple dispatchers accessing and updating incident information simultaneously. 

The security mindset I've developed is crucial for public safety applications where data integrity and system reliability can literally be matters of life and death. My understanding of authentication systems, secure API communication, and data validation provides a strong foundation for building systems that meet the stringent security requirements of emergency services. 

Perhaps most importantly, my combined experience as both a 911 dispatcher and a software developer gives me unique insight into the actual needs of public safety professionals. I understand the workflows, pain points, and critical requirements that must be addressed in emergency services technology. This dual perspective allows me to design and build solutions that are not just technically sound, but genuinely useful for the people who depend on them to do their jobs effectively. 

The problem-solving skills, attention to detail, and ability to work under pressure that I've developed through both my technical education and my work in emergency services have prepared me to take on the responsibility of creating technology that supports first responders and helps save lives. I'm excited to apply these skills in roles focused on improving and modernizing the critical systems that our communities depend on for emergency response.
